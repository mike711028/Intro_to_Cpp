# Introduction Classes
**Classes** enable you to create your own custom, self-contained, and reusable types. 
A class file is often considered a blueprint for objects that you use in your code. 
Typically you will create class files to help model real-world objects in your code. 

An example of this might be the software that manages a bank ATM.  The software would
need to understand the concept of customers, accounts, transactions, etc.   It's far easier 
to implement the software application by modelling these real world objects as software 
objects (classes) in your code.

In this module, you will gain an introduction to classes in C++ that will cover the basics only.
The second installment of the C++ course will delve deeper into object oriented concepts in C++.
