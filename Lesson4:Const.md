# Lesson 4 : Const
* const tells the compiler you won't try to change something
   * And the compiler will enfore this
* Using const correctly improves correctness
   * Save you from errors of thought
   * Allow optimizations at compile time
* Get const right at the beginning - very hard to add later
* Use const everywhere you can
