# Enumerations
In the topics on variables and constants, it was noted that anytime you want to create a value 
for use in a program, where the value should never change, you used a constant. An enumeration 
can be considered a way to create what are known as symbolic constants. The most common example is
to use an enum to define the day of the week. There are only seven possible values for days of the week, 
and you can be reasonably certain that these values will never change.
